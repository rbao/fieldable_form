v0.0.2 - 2013/03/21

* API CHANGE: Rename `FieldableForm::Validations` to `FieldableForm::EntryValidations`. Rename the method `#validate_fieldable_form` to `#validate_fieldable_form_entry`.
* API CHANGE: Rename `FieldableForm::AbstractField` to `FieldableForm::Field`.
* API CHANGE: Remove `FieldableForm::BaseForm`. You should implement this yourself a sample implementation can be found [Here](https://github.com/rbao/fieldable_form_example_app/blob/master/app/models/product_form.rb "Here"). The migration for this model is also removed, although no drop_table migration is added. However, you should rename the old `fieldable_forms` tables according to your model name.
* API CHANGE: `rails g fieldable_form:bootstrap` will no longer generate the model.
* DEPENDENCY CHANGE: Remove `jquery-rails` and `coffee-rails`, however if you plan to use the assets generated by `fieldable_form:bootstrap` you will still need to include those gem in your application.
